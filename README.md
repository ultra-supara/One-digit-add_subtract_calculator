# One-digit_add_subtract_calculator

- Simple design of 4-bit binary up-counter
- Design of halfadder & fulladder and verification of operation by logic simulation
- Design of 4-bit binary adder and verification of operation by logic simulation
- Design of 4-bit BCD adder and verification of its operation by logic simulation
- Design of a single-digit numerical add/subtract circuit and verification of its operation by logic simulation
- Once it is verified that the circuit works correctly, implement it in FPGA and check it in the production environment.
- RTL description (Register-Transfer Level) High level of abstraction in the order of { operation > register transfer > gate > transistor }

- Operating environment: Quartus-lite-20.1.0.711-windows
- FPGA:Altera Cyclone IV : <https://www.intel.co.jp/content/www/jp/ja/products/details/fpga/cyclone/iv/e.html>
